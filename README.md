Go Nagios
=========

This is a package with simple support for writing Nagios checks in Go.
Includes a few simple types and methods for behaving as a Nagios check.

Supports aggregating multiple check statuses into a final status and
message, with the highest priority winning out.

You might check out [check_docker](https://github.com/newrelic/check_docker)
for a good example of how to use it.
